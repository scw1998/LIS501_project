The quotes appeared with such frequency that I began to collect them. \n","When I started to track down information on them, I found that although many books \n","have been written about Last Words, very few authors told readers where the quotes \n","came from. And invariably, among the few books that provided Sources, the quotes \n","were in one place while the Sources were in another. Moreover, quotes presented as \n","Last Words often turned out not to be final utterances, although they may have dealt \n","with death and dying. \n","Sometimes Last Words compilers constructed direct quotations from indirect \n","ones. Also, some books gave such sparse information about the speaker or the Source \n","that it was difficult to tell who made the quote or where it came from. A few books \n","grouped the names by categories; others listed them chronologically. If the book had \n","no index or table of contents, finding a name was often a challenge. \n","In Last Words of Notable People, the emphasis is not on how famous, witty, \n","amusing, tragic or profound the quote is but where it originated, how accurate it is, \n","and what made the person notable who said it. Each entry includes a brief biography \n","with enough information to identify the individual and his or her claim to notability. \n","And it tells the reader where the quote came from. All entries are listed alphabetically \n","and are indexed. \n","You will notice the term “doubtful” next to some Last Words entries. This label \n","indicates the quotation is probably bogus as the person’s final words. See, for exam- \n","ple, Rabelais. Books of quotations, apothegms, maxims and anecdotes offer several \n","versions of his Last Words. But if you check his listing in this book, you will find \n","historians do not even know when the great man died let alone what he said! \n","Chaplin, Defoe and Montaigne all spoke the words attributed to them as Last Words, \n","Last Words of Notable People V \n","\n","but they said them in different contexts. In each instance, the quote appeared in his \n","works long before he died but somehow over the years evolved into his final utter- \n","ance. Some of these bogus quotes have been circulating for centuries. \n","Today, thanks to powerful Internet search engines, it is possible to track down \n","information in a way that earlier writers could never have imagined. But there is a \n","downside to Internet material: Some websites apparently have taken dubious quotes \n","from other websites. The result is a proliferation of suspect Last Words. \n","Many of the names in Last Words of Notable People have two, three, or more \n","Last Words attributed to the same person. When the quotes are different, they are \n","prefixed with the tag “Different Last Words” and are enumerated. If they are similar \n","to other quotes presented for the same individual, they are identified as “Variations.” \n","I do not mean to imply that these are the on/y Last Words for that individual. It just \n","means that among the materials examined, these are the dissimilarities I found. \n","Tracking down Last Words can be an exercise in frustration for the purist or the \n","researcher who wants to know the exact words the speaker uttered or wrote before \n","dying. It is difficult, or even impossible, to check the authenticity of someone’s Last \n","Words after the person has died. The passage of time can make verification difficult. \n","Sources can be corrupted. Written notes can be changed, erroneously transcribed, or \n","reported incorrectly. Even videotapes and photographs can be tampered with. Many \n","Last Words were initially oral tradition or hearsay and are often dependent on the \n","vested interests of a single witness or other person close to the speaker. \n","The last recorded words a person said might be misconstrued. Sometimes the \n","quote was made while the person was dying, but it was not necessarily his or her final \n","words. Family members may have distorted the Last Words because they could not \n","understand the speaker. Or perhaps they felt the speaker’s Last Words were not dig- \n","nified enough to become part of history, especially if the person was a prominent \n","clergyman, politician or other public figure. \n","Sometimes the people who were dying could not speak for themselves. Perhaps \n","their speech was impaired by a stroke or their teeth were gone, or their voice was \n","weak from prolonged ill health. Their Last Words may be interpreted for them by \n","vi Last Words of Notable People \n","\n","family or friends. See, for example, the Last Words of Princess Victoria Ka’iulani of \n","Hawaii. She uttered one word, but bystanders were not sure whether she said \n","29: 66 \n","“Mama,” “Papa” or “Koa” (nickname for her cousin). We may never know for sure \n","whether English statesman William Pitt the Younger said “How I Jove my country” \n","or “How I leave my country” or neither and instead expressed a desire for “Bellamy’s \n","veal pies.” \n","If you have ever had experience working with documents translated from one \n","language to another, you know meanings can get lost in translation. French Revolu- \n","tionary casualty Madame Roland’s Last Words have been translated from French to \n","English as: “O Liberty how you are mocked” and “Oh Liberty, what crimes are \n","committed in thy name.” Subtle transformations in translation changed composer \n","Franz Joseph Haydn’s “Children, be comforted. I am well” to the more prosaic \n","“Cheer up children, I’m all right.” \n","About the “Notable People” in this book: Some professions are better represented \n","than others. Politicians, military people and clergy are high on the list. Sports figures, \n","writers, artists, martyrs and musicians are also well documented. So are criminals. \n","Among these groups, Last Words are often carefully recorded. Sometimes media \n","people are eager to hang onto the Last Words of a celebrity for the sake of newswor- \n","thiness. \n","The brief biographies that accompany each entry aim to tie the Last Words \n","uniquely to that person. The state of the individual’s health or the things he or she \n","held important acquire special importance when put together with his or her final \n","pronouncements. Russian-born novelist Vladimir Nabokov’s Last Words were about \n","butterflies. They take on more significance if the reader knows that the author of Lo- \n","lita was also a world-class lepidopterist and mentioned butterflies in his writings. \n","Many Notable People experienced physical pain or mental torment. Knowing a per- \n","son suffered from an illness or had a disability can also give insights into his or her \n","Last Words. Mendelssohn’s “Weary, very weary” makes sense when you know death \n","came at the end of a series of strokes that sapped the energy from the 38-year-old \n","composer. \n","Last Words of Notable People Vii \n","\n","Many books, compilations and other materials were consulted in putting together \n","this collection of sourced Last Words.
